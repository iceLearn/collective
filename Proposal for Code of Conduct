Without a formal code of conduct, our norms are challenging to enforce.
A majority of online communities have some kind of code of conduct. 
However the Crowd Research Collective does not have one that targets the specific needs we face.


I propose a code of conduct based on the draft process - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hpBa460MFoG5qsKatxVPmdpF77VITetA-YGp7V3KlRY/ to be singed by every existing member of the collective and every new member to our community. 
The draft process is ongoing, so please participate by adding comments here, or by adding comments or suggestions to the linked document.
